Hello Dr. Mood,

Unfortunately I was not able to complete all of the assignment.  I thought I was very close yesterday but after looking over things with
Zac I found I was very far off.  The code I have works, but the design patterns are not exactly what the instructions entailed.  I 
tried implementing everything exactly as the instructions said but had some errors that I could not figure out.  I left all of the code
I attempted to implement in block comments.  When I catch up on my work, it would be great to meet in your office hours and cover what 
I have missed in this lesson.


Thank you,

Philip Jeffries
